Source for the Twitter bot [@remediationbot](https://www.twitter.com/remediationbot). Functions are related to the UK building safety crisis. It uses [{rtweet}](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to send Tweets at scheduled intervals. Code originally built by [@mattdray](https://twitter.com/mattdray), forked and edited by [@TheRealJimShady](https://twitter.com/therealjimshady).

Currently the main purpose is to highlight builders who have yet to sign the Governments pledge to remediate buildings they built with defects. If you would like your builder added, please add a pull request to the file 'companies_yet_to_sign.csv'.
